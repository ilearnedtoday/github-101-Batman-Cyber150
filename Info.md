## Git vs Github



   **Git:**

- Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes made to their code, collaborate with others, and maintain a record of all modifications.
- It's a decentralized system, meaning that every developer working on a project has a local copy of the entire project history.
- Git is a command-line tool that runs on your local machine.

GitHub:

- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a centralized location for Git repositories.
- It allows developers to host, share, and collaborate on Git repositories with others.
- GitHub offers additional features like issue tracking, project management, and social networking.
